            <div>
                <p>Starting with a small spark from our CEO and founder, Justin Ge, 
                    we have progressively grown as a group. We were formed with a small passion
                    about coding. After numerous sessions and meetings, we formed this company.
                    Creating small businesses like this can create larger ones, and you learn a 
                    lot throughout the process. When we first created this website, we had no
                    idea what we would be doing. Sometimes, making things up as you go is the best strategy.
                    You gain lots of experience. Sometimes, you need to create your own path. 
                    Humanity is not very versatile in that way. Since our sophistication, we have 
                    cut off a lot of creative and old ways of life that certainly would have made our
                    world a better place. In the end, keep strong, and see where your path takes you.
